# Admin Logout Fix - RESOLVED

## 🔍 Issue Identified and Fixed

### Problem:
When signing out from the admin panel at `http://localhost:3001/admin/login`, users were getting a 404 error instead of being redirected to the main website.

### Root Cause:
1. **Missing Navigation in Logout**: The logout function only cleared tokens but didn't redirect users
2. **Multiple Auth Systems**: AdminHeader was using separate `adminToken`/`adminUser` instead of the main AuthContext
3. **Wrong Redirect**: AdminHeader was redirecting to `/admin/login` instead of home page

### ✅ Solution Applied:

#### 1. Updated AdminSidebar Logout
**Before:**
```javascript
const handleLogout = () => {
  logout()
  setSidebarOpen(false)
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleLogout = () => {
  logout()
  setSidebarOpen(false)
  navigate('/')  // Redirect to home page
}
```

#### 2. Fixed AdminHeader Authentication
**Before:**
- Used separate `adminToken`/`adminUser` localStorage
- Redirected to `/admin/login` after logout

**After:**
- Uses AuthContext `logout()` and `user`
- Redirects to `/` (home page) after logout
- Unified authentication system

#### 3. Enhanced Imports
- Added `useNavigate` to AdminSidebar
- Added `useAuth` to AdminHeader for consistent auth handling

### 🧪 How to Test the Fix:

1. **Login as Admin**: Go to `http://localhost:3001/admin/login`
2. **Access Admin Panel**: Navigate through admin sections
3. **Logout via Sidebar**: Click logout in left sidebar
4. **✅ Expected**: Redirected to `http://localhost:3001/` (home page)
5. **Logout via Header**: Click user menu → Sign out
6. **✅ Expected**: Redirected to `http://localhost:3001/` (home page)

### 🔧 Technical Details:

**Files Modified:**
- `AdminSidebar.jsx` ✅ Added navigation to logout
- `AdminHeader.jsx` ✅ Fixed auth system and redirect

**Authentication Flow:**
```
Admin Login → Admin Panel → Logout → Home Page (/)
```

**Previous (Broken) Flow:**
```
Admin Login → Admin Panel → Logout → 404 Error or admin/login
```

### 🎯 Testing Results Expected:
- ✅ Admin logout from sidebar redirects to home
- ✅ Admin logout from header menu redirects to home  
- ✅ No more 404 errors after logout
- ✅ Users can navigate back to public website
- ✅ Consistent authentication across admin components

The admin logout functionality now properly redirects users to the main website! 🚀
