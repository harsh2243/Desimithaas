# Complete Order Management Workflow

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive order management system implemented in the TheKua e-commerce platform, covering the complete workflow from order placement to delivery.

## Order Status Flow

### 1. Order Placement (User Side)

#### A. Cash on Delivery (COD) Orders
```
User clicks "Buy Now" → Login Check → Add to Cart → Checkout → Confirm Order
Initial Status: orderStatus = "pending", paymentStatus = "pending"
```

#### B. UPI/Razorpay Orders  
```
User clicks "Buy Now" → Login Check → Add to Cart → Checkout → Payment → Confirm Order
Initial Status: orderStatus = "confirmed", paymentStatus = "completed"
```

### 2. Admin Order Management

#### Order Status Progression:
```
pending → confirmed → processing → shipped → delivered
                ↓
           (cancellable)
```

#### Admin Dashboard Features:
- View all orders with filtering and search
- Update order status with dropdown
- Add tracking numbers
- Set estimated delivery dates
- Add admin notes
- View detailed order information

### 3. User Order Management

#### User Features:
- View order history with status tracking
- Progress bar showing order journey
- Cancel orders (only pending/confirmed COD orders)
- Search and filter orders

## Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

#### User Endpoints:
- `GET /api/orders` - Get user's orders
- `GET /api/orders/:id` - Get specific order details
- `PUT /api/orders/:id/cancel` - Cancel order
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order

#### Admin Endpoints:
- `GET /api/admin/orders` - Get all orders (with pagination/filtering)
- `PUT /api/admin/orders/:id/status` - Update order status
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard` - Get order statistics

### Database Schema

```javascript
Order Schema:
{
  orderNumber: String (auto-generated: THK000001),
  user: ObjectId (ref: User),
  items: [OrderItemSchema],
  shippingAddress: ShippingAddressSchema,
  paymentMethod: 'cod' | 'razorpay' | 'upi',
  paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'refunded',

  totalAmount: Number,
  shippingCharge: Number,
  finalAmount: Number,
  trackingNumber: String,
  estimatedDelivery: Date,
  deliveredAt: Date,
  cancellationReason: String,
  adminNotes: String
}
```
