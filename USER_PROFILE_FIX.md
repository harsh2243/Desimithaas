# User Profile Save Issue - FIXED

## 🔍 Issue Identified and Fixed

### Problem:
The user profile edit form was not saving because of an API endpoint mismatch:

**Frontend was calling:** `/api/user/profile`  
**Working endpoint:** `/api/auth/profile`

### Root Cause:
1. The `UserProfile.jsx` component was using the wrong API endpoint
2. The `/api/user/profile` route had authentication issues with `req.user.userId` vs `req.user._id`
3. The `/api/auth/profile` route works correctly with `req.user._id`

### ✅ Solution Applied:

#### 1. Fixed API Endpoint in UserProfile Component
**Before:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5001/api/user/profile', {
```

**After:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5001/api/auth/profile', {
```

#### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added better error logging
- Added response text parsing for debugging
- Improved error messages

### 🧪 How to Test the Fix:

1. **Open the website**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Navigate to Profile**: Login → Click profile avatar → Profile
3. **Edit Profile**: Click "Edit Profile" button
4. **Make Changes**: Update any field (name, phone, address)
5. **Save**: Click "Save" button
6. **✅ Expected Result**: "Profile updated successfully!" toast message appears

### 🔧 Technical Details:

**Working API Route:** `/api/auth/profile` (PUT)
- Uses `req.user._id` (correct)
- Proper authentication middleware
- Validated request body
- Returns updated user data

**Broken API Route:** `/api/user/profile` (PUT)  
- Uses `req.user.userId` (incorrect - this field doesn't exist)
- Authentication middleware sets `req.user` to full user object
- Would cause `Cannot read property 'userId' of undefined` errors

### 📝 Files Modified:
- `client/src/components/user/UserProfile.jsx` ✅ Fixed API endpoint

### 🎯 Testing Results Expected:
- ✅ Profile form loads with current user data
- ✅ Edit mode enables form fields
- ✅ Save button successfully updates profile
- ✅ Toast notification shows success
- ✅ Updated data persists on page refresh
- ✅ Form exits edit mode after successful save

The user profile save functionality should now work correctly! 🚀
